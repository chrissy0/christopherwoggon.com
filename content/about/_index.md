## Skills

**Technology**
#### Python

My go-to programming language. Great for quick prototyping of ideas. I have gained a deep understanding of the language through the conception of a [TU Berlin](https://tu.berlin/) university course on the language. Recently, I have been using it extensively for Machine Learning related tasks.

#### JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Next.js)

I have built multiple [React](https://renderlab.io/) and [Next.js](https://zendone.app/) projects, as well as utilized TypeScript extensively for Supabase edge functions.

#### Java

I have successfully completed and maintained various client projects using Java as the core technology. Although I have shifted my focus to Python in recent years, I am still fond of Java.

#### Docker

I have utilized Docker to great success in various projects. It made the deployment of finalized projects a seamless experience for both me and the client.
