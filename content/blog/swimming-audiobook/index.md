If you’re anything like me, you love swimming. Recently, this hobby of mine has gotten a massive upgrade when I ordered the Shokz OpenSwim headphones.

While great for music, for me, the real strength of these headphones is allowing me to listen to podcasts and audiobooks during my workouts. While workouts at the gym are usually too intense to focus, swimming while learning about new topics is great.

Due to Bluetooth not working in water, these headphones are basically MP3 players. This seemed a bit annoying to me at first, but by now I love having a separate device, allowing me to immerse myself in a podcast or book without constant interruptions.

One feature I’m missing is skipping ahead or back inside a single track, for example a 7 hour audiobook. This post explores how to get around this limitation.

My workaround is chopping up long MP3s like podcasts and audiobooks into 2 minute chunks. This essentially turns the skip track functionality into a skip ahead function, allowing me to skip ahead and crucially rewind a piece of media in two minute increments.

The code I’ve written for this purpose also increases the volume of the audio file, as conversation is sometimes hard to hear in the water. Bonus tip: enable swimming mode before starting your workout. This makes conversation more clear.

Here‘s the code I’ve come up with.

```python

Notes to myself:

- Copy code
- Keep place in book
